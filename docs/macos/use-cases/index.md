#### Prompt

```
Retrieve the unread emails in my inbox and using only the email information determine if each one is “Junk” or “Not junk”. Promotional emails count as junk. One strong signal for junk email is if it contains an unsubscribe option near the end of the email.

Your response should be only the list of junk emails. Each list item starts with the email subject followed by a one sentence justification for why each email is junk. Do not mention emails that are not junk.

Then tell me the total number of emails that were categorized as junk vs total emails analyzed.
```
