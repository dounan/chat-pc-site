## Add recommended actions

Actions allow ChatPC to interact with your local computer and interact with other native applications.

When you first open the chat window, you'll be presented with an option to add the recommended actions.

![add recommeneded actions](/images/macos-getting-started/add-recommended-actions.png)

Actions can be managed in the ChatPC settings `Actions` tab.

Note that the more actions you add, the more credits you will consume per chat message.

## Try out some prompts!

Open the chat window, and enter the following prompt:

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  Create a new folder on my desktop named after today's date
</div>

Approve the action to create the folder. Then enter the following prompt:

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  Write a short haiku and save it in that new folder as poem.txt
</div>

Approve the action to create the file. Then enter the following prompt:

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  Open the poem file
</div>

## Manage your chats

1. Use the title bar to start a new chat, view previous chats, and delete chats.

## Grant permissions

1. As you use ChatPC, you may be prompted for additional permissions as needed:

    - `Accessibility features` (you can change this setting anytime in your Mac's `System Settings` > `Privacy & Security` > `Accessibility`)

        ![accessibility permission alert](/images/macos-getting-started/accessibility-alert.png)

        ![accessibility permission alert](/images/macos-getting-started/accessibility-enable.png)

    - `"ChatPC.app" wants access to control...` (you can change these settings anytime in your Mac's `System Settings` > `Privacy & Security`)

        ![system events permission alert](/images/macos-getting-started/system-events-alert.png)

## Open the chat window

If you closed the chat window, you can open it any time by clicking the ChatPC icon in the MacOS menu bar. Any selected text in the frontmost window will be pre-populated into the chat input.

## Subscription plans

The default free plan has a lifetime credit limit as well as other limitations. You can manage your subscription plan in the app settings.

Check out the [available subscription plans](https://chatpc.ai/plans).

With a subscription plan, you can enter your own OpenAI API key to avoid using your ChatPC credits. You can set your OpenAI API key under `Chat` settings.
