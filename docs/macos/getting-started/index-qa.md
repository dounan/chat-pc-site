Actions allow ChatPC to interact with your local computer and interact with other native applications.

When you first open the chat window, you'll be presented with an option to add the recommended actions.

Actions can be managed in the [ChatPC settings](#acccessing-settings) `Actions` tab.

Note that the more actions you add, the more credits you will consume per chat message.
