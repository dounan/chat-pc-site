## Designed with safety in mind

With ChatPC, you dictate the rules. It's designed from the ground up to ensure your peace of mind.

### üõ†Ô∏è You are in control

By default, ChatPC can't access any of your files or run any Shortcuts or AppleScripts. Only grant permissions to what you're comfortable with.

### üõÇ Explicit approvals

Ensure even more security by configuring which actions need your approval before executing.

### üîê End-to-end data privacy

Your data is your data. It is never used for training models and all communication between ChatPC and OpenAI are encrypted. See OpenAI's [Enterprise Privacy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy) for more information.

## Integrate seemlessly into your workflows

In addition to the built-in ChatPC chat interface, you can also prompt ChatPC inside your Shortcuts or AppleScripts!

## How does it work?

1. Enable ChatPC to perform actions by adding folders, Shortcuts, and AppleScripts

1. Prompt ChatPC through the built-in chat interface, a Shortcut, or an AppleScript

1. ChatPC's AI (powered by OpenAI GPT-3 and GPT-4) decides what actions to take and executes them
